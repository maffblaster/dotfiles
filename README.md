### .bashrc

Contains aliases for coreutils commands:

ll: A human readable, almost-all inclusive, long listing for `ls` that includes the following special characters for file types:

### .tmux.conf

Settings to enhance tmux's out-of-the-box experience. Highlights include:

### .vimrc

Requires app-vim/molokai or app-vim/extra-syntax for all set commands to work as expected.
